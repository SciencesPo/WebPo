TO DO NEXT
==========

* think about a "demo" site, where people could browse into layout models for integrate in the pages. They should be able to copy the model and paste it into their page
* think about a tagging process in the Gdoc page to delimit some areas of functionalities, such as accordion, carrousel and others..
* list the needed areas (carrousel, image, read more..) in a Gsheet, with the corresponding tags (ie: Gdoc functionality or gooThon tag)
